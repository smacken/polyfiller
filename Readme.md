Polyfiller

The intention is to outline common Html5 polyfills for use with Modernizr in conjunction with it's library of Polyfills.
Project will commonly use a number of Html5 functionality which make sense to be filled in bootstrap from the get go.

There is also a gap in the knowledge of common techniques for leveraging Modernizr with it's polyfils.

There are a number of fills which if you are using Html5 then you are most likely going to want to use.
For functionality that you might not use, there is a flag based config object which can control fills being injected.

Some of the fills require additional Css to be implemented. This could possibly an extention using less to create mixins which could encapsulate the additional css fill behaviour.
